The deployment redirects you to the login page.
You can signup by clicking on "Sign me Up" button.
On succesful login you are redirected to the Home page.
You can click on the top navbar to open sidepan which allows you to view different boards and select a board.
On selecting a board, it opens in the main page, with different lists.
You can create a new list, delete old lists.
You can also move the lists around the board(How cool is that!)
A lot of other features couldnt be implemented due to lack of time.

Used MERN stack for development.

Deployed using nginx, pm2 on aws.
