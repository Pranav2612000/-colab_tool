<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
There are many TODO managing applications, but none of them are as intuitive to use as togthrdo. Togthrdo allows you to create lists, add cards to lists and drag these cards between lists, as other applications. But the reason why toghtrdo is better, is because, it allows users to drag and move lists around on the board - to create meaningful views for managing your tasks.
Some of its features include:
* Allow users to login and register to save their lists and cards
* Create cards which automatically expire after due date
* Customize colors of lists
* Fuzzy search across all lists and cards
* Realistic UI

Watch [this](https://youtu.be/V-zRiwnVuY4) video to see how it works.
